# CRUD Patterns in Solidity - 2026-01-08-15-58

## Overview
Comprehensive guide to implementing Create, Read, Update, Delete operations in smart contracts.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Create Operations
- Struct initialization
- Mapping storage
- Event emission
- Input validation

### 2. Read Operations
- View functions
- Memory vs storage
- Gas optimization
- Batch queries

### 3. Update Operations
- Access control
- State modifications
- Timestamp tracking
- Update events

### 4. Delete Operations
- Soft delete patterns
- Hard delete considerations
- Gas implications
- Data retention

## Best Practices
- Always validate inputs
- Use events for off-chain tracking
- Implement access control
- Consider gas costs
- Test edge cases

## Security Considerations
- Reentrancy protection
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Access control checks
- Input sanitization
